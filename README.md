# Midfield
2D platforming game prototype
<br>The game idea and concept is heavily inspired by another game named "Jump King"

Official site of that game: https://www.jump-king.com/

The player can move by either jumping or walking, trying to reach the top.
<br>Jumps can be charged by holding a space key, so player has to take caution and decide when, where and how much jump force to use.
<br>The game encourages players to explore different routes to find more comfortable paths up.

### Game controls
A/left arrow - left
<br>D/right arrow - right
<br>space - jump - has 3 different jump heights
<br>P - pause
<br>Escape - options menu
