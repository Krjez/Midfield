# Midfield
2D platforming game prototype
The game idea and concept is heavily inspired by another game named "Jump King"

Official site of that game: https://www.jump-king.com/

The player can move by either jumping or walking, trying to reach the top.
Jumps can be charged by holding a space key, so player has to tak caution and decide when, where and how much jump force to use.
The game encourages players explore different routes to find more comfortable paths up.
